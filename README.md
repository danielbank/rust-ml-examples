Rust ML Examples

## Talking Points

-   How does linear regression work (explanation of why input is matrix and targets is a vector)

-   Python Example just for comparison

-   Rusty Machine Slides explaining Model traits

-   Finding the length of the deserialize borrowed iterator (finally got `count()` to work and it was 0, lazy iterator?)

-   Rusty Machine Linear Algebra vs Rust Sim (And the future???)
